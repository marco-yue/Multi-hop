# Dynamic on-demand delivery with spatial division of Labors

This repository is the implementation of the paper "Dynamic on-demand delivery with spatial divisions of Labor".

The rise of on-demand delivery services has been steady alongside the expansion of e-commerce. However, the significant increase in parcel volume poses considerable challenges in meeting service expectations, particularly in the face of uncertain demand patterns. To address these challenges, this paper investigates the concept of \textit{spatial divisions of labor} in on-demand deliveries. Under this concept, the entire delivery network is divided into several operational regions, with each courier responsible for managing a specific region. Additionally, a set of accessible lockers strategically placed at the borders of these regions facilitates parcel transshipment between adjacent regions. This paper presents the Multi-hop Delivery with Spatial Divisions of Labor (MDSDL) problem and tackles it with a rolling time horizon approach. It tackles two primary issues: (i) dynamically determining the delivery path for each parcel request within the system, and (ii) resolving the routing problem for individual couriers. A novel heuristic approach is developed to address the MDSDL problem, and extensive comparative experiments are conducted to demonstrate its advantages. The implementation of \textit{spatial divisions of labor} can lead to higher efficiency and lower operational costs in the long term, while also enhancing the customer experience through shorter latency time and ready-to-pickup time.
